Steps to login Cityonchain

1. open www.cityonchain.com, click "login" which is on the top right of the main page. It will redirect to Money Button
2. If you have already logged on to Money Button,  click "continue as (your account)". If succeed, it will return to cityonchain.
3. If you don't have a Money Button account, register one, save seeds, and transfer some BSV to your account. Then follow step 1.

#### City Trading

After you purchase a city, you become a city owner, who will benefit from kinds of city activities.

A city can be set to one of the two status, 'sell' or 'not for sale', corresponding to the blue and gray labels on map.

On the map page, you can select a city by zooming in the map and choosing a blue label, or, you may search a city from the search bar. Once a city is selected, the city information will show up on the right, including its selling status and price. Click "purchase", a confirmation popup. Then double check, and slide the button to finish the payment.

Upon completing the purchase, you need to set a new selling status on the popup window. Pay attention to your new selling price, or you can keep it as "not for sale". Then, post your on-chain advertisement in the city with only 2 cents, or do it later. Both the price setting and ad editing are accessible from your information page.

To access your information page, click your username on the top right corner. There, you can see your account balance, manage your own cities, and check all the transaction records.
